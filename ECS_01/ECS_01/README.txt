Controls:

WASD to move the controllable GameObject.
QE to rotate
ZC to scale up and down the controllable GameObject
Up Down numpad keys to zoom in and out
X toggles the Camera component from World relative to GameObject relative(no toggle implementation yet, so it cycles very quickly)

The smaller box is there just to give a reference for movement.
